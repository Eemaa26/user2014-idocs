## Interactive Documents with R

Dear UseR2014 Attendees,

I will be doing an afternoon tutorial at [UseR2014](http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu/#tutorials) on June 30th 2014. It is scheduled to be held on the 4th floor of the Sproul Landing building, from __14:00 - 17:30__.

The main goal of this tutorial is to provide a comprehensive overview of the workflow required to create, customize and share interactive web-friendly documents from R. We will cover a range of topics from how to create interactive visualizations and dashboards, to web pages and applications, straight from R. At the end of this tutorial, attendees will be able to apply these learnings to turn their own analyses and reports into interactive, web-friendly content. 

If you are curious about what you will learn, here is a short screencast to tickle your interest.

### Outline

__Part 1__:  The first hour of the tutorial will introduce the concept of interactive documents and cover the basic tools required to author them. We will go over [R Markdown](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/r_markdown), [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr), and [slidify](http://slidify.github.io). At the end of this part, users will be able to create and share a simple web-based interactive document.

__Part 2__: The second hour of the tutorial will focus on different ways to add interactivity to the document. It would cover both client-side solutions using packages like [rCharts](http://rcharts.io) and [slidify](http://slidify.github.io) and server-side solutions involving [Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/) and [OpenCPU](http://opencpu.org).

__Part 3__: The last hour of the workshop will take attendees through more advance concepts to customize the documents they create and also author their own interactive widgets. We will also go over a short case study, that will help attendees understand the workflow that would simplify the process of creating, customizing and sharing dynamic, interactive documents.

### Background

Attendees are expected to have a basic working knowledge of R, including data structures and functions. Knowledge of `markdown` and `knitr` is recommended, but NOT required. To get the most out of this tutorial, I recommended that attendees bring their own laptops.

In addition, please complete the following steps prior to attending the workshop. This would ensure that we can hit the ground running, and don't waste precious time troubleshooting basic stuff. 

1. [Install required packages](chapter1/install.html)
2. [Run through first steps](chapter1/first-steps.html)
3. [Sign up on Hackpad](https://ramnathv.hackpad.com/idocs)

I will be updating this site with slides and material for the workshop. You can bookmark it [here](http://github.com/ramnathv/user2014-idocs). Meanwhile, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate in asking them [here](http://github.com/ramnathv/user2014-idocs/issues/new). 

I look forward to seeing you at the workshop!

Cheers,
Ramnath
